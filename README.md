Profanity &amp; Hate Speech Detection


In this repository, we will be looking at how create a Profanity & Hate Speech Detector and also how to create a TensorFlow Lite model that can be used in the development of an Android Application to curb Profanity & Hateful Speeches.

I have created a Profanity_&_Hate_Speech_Detection.ipynb that you can use to analyse and create the hrs tflite model.

You can then added the model into the assests folder to run the use it in the android application.

The above images show the working of the application
